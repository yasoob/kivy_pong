Kivy Pong
-----------

This is a simple pong game which I made by following the tutorial available [here](http://kivy.org/docs/tutorials/pong.html). I improved and modified it a bit by removing a *so called* bug (the ball's velocity increased after hitting the padal) and by placing a nice background image.

This project was done for a task from fossasia.
