Kivy Pong
-----------

This is a simple pong game which I made by following the tutorial available [here](http://kivy.org/docs/tutorials/pong.html). I improved and modified it a bit by removing a *so called* bug (the ball's velocity increased after hitting the padal) and by placing a nice background image.

This project was done for a task from fossasia.

The background image was taken from [Tuts+](http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-a-pong-game-in-html5-with-easeljs--active-10706)
